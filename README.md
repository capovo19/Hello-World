# Hello-World

Hi Dear!

I'm a Linux System Administrator with a lot of experience now trying to master git/github to make myself more relevant in my job. 
This is really important to me in fact that I always love learning to grow in knowledge skills and in my career. 
I'm self-motivated self-starter, multitasking, teamplayer with strong leadership and organization.
I'm always focus on my improvement.
IT is my passion.
